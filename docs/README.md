# üçæ Getting started

zQuests is a unique quest plugin that offers a different approach compared to others. You can choose to enable or disable the default quests, but to proceed with quests, you must activate them either manually or automatically. Use zMenu actions to trigger quests, or utilize commands for more control. Combine multiple quests to create larger, more challenging adventures. Leverage placeholders and the power of zMenu to configure your inventories and create immersive gameplay experiences.
